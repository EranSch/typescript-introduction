# TypeScript
_An introduction to the first JavaScript compiler-thingy you should consider caring about._

Here are the demo files from my presentation on 4/16/15. The slides can be viewed [here](http://slides.com/eranschoellhorn/typescript). I forgot to hit the record button so there's no screen recording. I'll try and pull that together some other time. 

**Topics Include:**

- Difference between dynamic and statically typed languages
- Exploration of optional typing provided by TypeScript
- Using ES6 modules in TypeScript
- Implementing Browserify and TypeScript together
